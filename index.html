		  It’s no longer a question of whether art institutions should have a
		  virtual presence. Rather, the onus is being placed on designers to
		  facilitate meaningful interactions with art that might occur in the
		  gallery, via Web-based applications or in new hybrid spaces that merge
		  the real and the virtual. Any attempt to augment an encounter with
		  artwork using technological means invariably raises questions about the
		  values we assign to certain modes of viewing. After all, isn’t visiting
		  a museum inherently tied to a very deep, very primary real-life
		  experience? The promises and pitfalls of new technologies are forcing
		  <a href="https://www.artnews.com/t/museums/">museums</a>to rebalance
		  their traditional mandates to care for a collection of physical objects
		  while enabling scholarship and providing the wider public an opportunity
		  to engage with works of art. —R.G. and S.H.

			<p class="Interview">
				While I currently work in an art museum, my personal engagement with
				art and digital mediaa—online publishing, blogging and the social Web,
				in particular—has developed over the course of nearly 20 years. In
				that time, I have observed the ways in which the physical experience
				of looking at art has become increasingly mediated by technology, a
				process that has only intensified as the Web became constantly
				accessible via mobile devices. When considering the role of the
				so-called digital audience for an art institution, I imagine the
				individual who may never stand in a given physical site, yet may
				nevertheless engage with a work of art, performance or installation
				through the digital interface of a website or app. While museums
				sometimes make problematic judgments about what an art experience
				should or shouldn’t be—and enforce those pedagogical prescriptions
				through architecture, texts and other didactic materials, public
				programming and, of course, the placement of art works themselves—we
				simply have to acknowledge and even accept the ever-changing role
				technology plays in that experience, for better or for worse. In doing
				so, we can begin to glean a more nuanced and critical understanding of
				how people encounter art in physical and virtual spaces.

				<h2>Rob Giampietro</h2>
			    <p class="Interview">
				I’ve worked as a designer on a diverse range of interfaces
				and websites for cultural institutions, artists, architects,
				philosophers and more. I find it fascinating how ideas from the physical
				world can be translated—crudely or elegantly—to the metaphorical space
				of the screen. I’m also interested in what could be considered native
				about this space, what the screen uniquely provides. In particular, I
				share the view of so many of the field’s pioneers that interactive
				technology is a branch of cinema In his 1955 book Designing for People,
				industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss was one of the first to write of
				designing a “man-machine interface”—in that case, a more accessible
				cockpit for pilots in WWII. By applying techniques from the emerging
				fields of ergonomics and information theory, Dreyfuss and his team aimed
				to integrate controls, seating and instrumentation in order to close the
				gap between a pilot and his aircraft. Like the full-room scale of the
				first mainframe computers, the cockpit subsumed its human operator—it
				was an interface that was also an environment, operating at the scale of
				architecture. In the same book, Dreyfuss turns his attention from the
				hard lessons of war to the soft power of culture, evoking another bit of
				architecture that might be reshaped by the new logic of the interface:
				the museum. “A half-hour’s tour through a museum with a TV camera,” he
				wrote, “can bring to life a wealth of art and knowledge that could
				otherwise not be seen in months.” 1 Once again Dreyfuss was aiming to
				close a gap, to give people immediate access to all the world’s artwork.
				Paradoxically, his scheme for facilitating this immediacy required the
				mediating device of broadcast television.

					The camera still weighs heavily on our physical experience of the
					museum. Surrealist and Bauhaus-era exhibition designers first began to
					condition us for this, even though their gestures long predated the
					ubiquitous presence of screens in our everyday lives. I think of Kurt
					Schwitters’s Merzbau, an immersive environment the German artist
					constructed in the 1920s and ’30s, or the work of László Moholy-Nagy and
					Herbert Bayer. These artists and designers introduced radical spatial
					configurations and new conventions of display that altered the
					conditions for viewing art, prompting people to behave and interact
					differently. Now, our cameras are embedded in the smartphones many of us
					hold as constant companions; by presenting and circulating photography
					in still-novel ways, applications such as Instagram and Vine are also
					enabling new phenomenologies around the way art is encountered,
					experienced and considered. Though written comments are still a primary
					form of online social interaction, the photograph now functions as a
					form of commenting, as we make implied statements by posting images
					instead of words. This is a complicated prospect when we consider how
					woefully prevalent miscommunication can be with words—imagine the vast
					room for interpretation a photograph offers. If we think about this
					phenomenon in the museum context we are faced with a difficult set of
					questions. For example, what does it mean for us to encounter an
					artist’s work for the first time via Facebook or Instagram or Vine?

					I’m sure that happens a lot! I wonder if we fast-forwarded a few years
					wether we might find other commercial Web platforms absorbing museum
					functions. For example, Etsy or Ebay might just as frequently be used
					for organizing and browsing object data as a museum website. I know
					curators of design objects and even librarians with non-book collections
					who’ve found the expert communities and the knowledge they’ve generated
					from these sites to be useful in filling in gaps in collection data.
